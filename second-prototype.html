      <p>
        This week, we were tasked with putting together a second prototype based
        on the feedback from our first prototype. Like last week, we built two
        versions of the prototype. One version is built in Unity, and aims to
        deliver on the gameplay aspects of the experience.
      </p>

      />

      <p>
        Our improved Unity prototype includes the scenes from our previous Unity
        prototype that are more fully fleshed out. The paragliding level has a
        goal and improved instructions, and the beginnings of the hospital level
        now include surreal animated textures and post-processing effects. Music
        and sound design were also added, making the experience feel more
        complete. Additionally, the player character’s thoughts appear as text
        throughout the experience.
      </p>

        alt="After the crash landing"
      />

      <p>
        The second version is a text-based prototype with sounds and abstract
        animations to set the mood. It aims to convey the narrative aspect of
        the game in a more complete package than would have been possible in
        Unity within our timeframe.
      </p>

        alt="This game gets kind of weird."
      />

      <p>
        One of the main pieces of criticism we received on our original
        text-based prototype is that many choices lead to the same result. With
        this new version, we wanted to expand on the consequences of your
        actions, which meant a lot of writing! For example, your conversation
        with the psychotic AI digital clock (pictured above) will effect
        dialogue later on, and ultimately influence your chances of surviving
        the clock’s deadly ultimatum. Sentences and word choices might be
        altered slightly based on the clocks “mood,” which is a numeric value
        that increases or decreases based on your dialogue choices. Similarly,
        throughout the journey you will accrue “trauma” which has an impact on
        whether you make a healthy recovery.

      <p>
        This version of the game is playable in desktop browsers that aren’t
        Safari <a href="https://www.bandaloo.fun/forward/">here</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        We are looking forward to the insights we gather from the play testing
        session. We anticipate that the web-based prototype will provoke
        discussion about the structure of the interactive narrative, while the
        Unity prototype will let us field test the gameplay elements so that we
        may continue to refine them based on feedback.

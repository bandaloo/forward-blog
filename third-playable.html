      <p>
        In the previous week, we sent out a form for players to fill out after
        going through our second playable demo. We had three Likert scale
        questions on a scale of 1-5:
      </p>

      <p>1. How easy was it for you to know what to do? (Average: 2.625)</p>

      <p>2. How difficult was the overall challenge? (Average: 4.125)</p>

      <p>3. Did the sound design enhance the atmosphere? (Average: 4.625)</p>

      <p>
        People felt as though the game was very difficult on average, which was
        somewhat surprising to us. This is not the experience we intended to
        create, and through observing playtesters it became clear that the
        <i>kinds</i> of challenges players were facing were not satisfying ones.
        Typically, players would be battling with the physics system or simply
        be confused about where to go. Improved tutorialization and the tweaking
        of physics are two things we know we need to focus on.
      </p>

      <p>
        We also had two open response questions, asking for suggestions on how
        best to deliver the narrative and what peoples' personal favorite parts
        of the game were. People responded positively to the maze level, stating
        that the puzzle was interesting and mechanically sound, however the
        metaphor about "recovery" in this level was the weakest. Players also
        liked the sports theming of the see-saw level still had difficulties
        with some interpreting some of the signage within the arena.
      </p>

      <p>
        Users had a variety of suggestions on how to deliver the dialogue, from
        voice acting, text bubbles, dialogue prompts and environmental
        storytelling. We have implemented a few of these techniques for this
        week's playable and we are looking forward to the feedback.
      </p>

      <p>
        During the new development cycle, began to address some of the
        difficulties people had with the "support level", the level in which the
        player switches between two characters to complete the puzzle. This
        involved a lot of trial and error, adjusting the masses of the objects
        and modifying some other properties to make them easier to hold and
        stand on. For example the moveable ramp was very difficult for users to
        orient correctly, so this was changed to a movable block that the player
        would use to connect a static ramp with a bridge.

      <p>
        We also included collectibles in the form of hidden notes that can be
        found throughout the environment (although these collectibles aren't
        particularly hidden at the moment!) This allows the player to piece
        together some of the story elements while encouraging exploration at the
        same time. We aim to follow a "show don't tell" philosophy with these
        collectibles. The player can view the journal at any time through the
        menu.

      <p>
        In previous weeks, players had wondered where some of the scenes and
        puzzles went from our previous prototypes. We brought back the
        paragliding scene which enhanced gameplay and a better cutscene that
        demonstrates the collision with another pilot.

      />

      <p>
        We also implemented the conversation with the clock that was present in
        the early post-Twine text-based prototype. We are thrilled with the
        result of this; it is great to see some of the narrative components of
        our early prototype brought into the Unity version.

      />

      <p>
        We have also begun to flesh out the final scene on the pirate ship.
        Eventually, this ship will deliver the player across the ocean for a
        full recovery, or sink into the ocean. The overall framework for the
        story is present from beginning to end in this version of the game.

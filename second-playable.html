      <p>
        This week, the two levels we presented previously underwent various
        improvements in sound design, visual presentation and gameplay. The
        first level we showed last week was the “Hot Cold” level. In the center
        of the stage is a large seesaw contraption that is being thrown out of
        balance by falling viruses. The player must pick up giant pill bottles
        and place them in the buckets in order to balance out the seesaw. Too
        far to one side, and your temperature will start to rise. Too far to the
        other, and it will begin to plummet.
      </p>

      <p>
        This stage underwent a major overhaul based on the feedback we received
        from the previous week. Before, pills would pile up in one location,
        which meant the player would only need to go back and forth between the
        pill pile and the bucket in order to complete the task. There was no
        need to make use of the teleporters or adapt your strategy. We now make
        only a few pills spawn at a time. Additionally, we scatter these spawn
        locations around the map, forcing the player to move throughout the
        entire level, learning its layout.
      </p>

      />

      <p>
        Before, it was difficult to see exactly what was in the buckets of the
        seesaw, so we added a basketball scoreboard at the top of the arena; the
        teams are VIRUS versus MEDICINE. Another display shows countdown until
        the next virus drop, and a “threat level” which indicates how heavy that
        virus will be. This threat level can be anywhere from “mild” to
        “deadly”.
      </p>

      <p>
        We ran into one compatibility issue with a package we imported to get an
        “icy” effect over the screen when the player is hypothermic. This effect
        looks normal on Windows, but when building for Mac, the screen is
        rendered completely gray and nothing can be seen. We will find a
        cross-platform solution in the future. The Mac build for this week will
        have this effect disabled.
      </p>

      <p>
        We hope the improved spawn locations and additional information will add
        greater strategy and reduce confusion. We are eager to see how people
        react to this revamped gameplay.
      </p>

      <p>
        The timed maze level got a visual overhaul and is a bit more moody!
        Colored lights were placed around the doors and switches to make the
        gameplay mechanics more clear. The skybox was changed to a surreal,
        colorful shader material as well. During our play sessions last week, we
        were told to bring back some of the “trippier” elements from our earlier
        demos. The visual presentation is still far from finished, but we
        believe it is a step in the right direction.
      </p>

      />

      <p>
        We also plan to present a level this week that we weren’t able to
        present last week, which has the player switching between two characters
        to solve environmental puzzles. The first character can run and jump
        while the second character is in a wheelchair; both are needed to reach
        the end.
      </p>

      />

      <p>
        There were also quite a few sound design improvements. Sound effects
        were added to highlight the character’s physical condition; a heartbeat
        plays while you are underwater, your character’s breathing will change
        when you have a high fever or are hypothermic on top of various other
        subtle enhancements.
      </p>

      <p>
        We toyed with the idea of including comic-book pages hidden in each
        level in order to bring in the narrative. However, we came to realize
        that writing, storyboarding and inking an entire comic would be out of
        scope for what we have time for. Instead, we plan to have handwritten
        notes as collectibles.
      </p>

      <p>
        At this point, we are hoping to finalize some of the gameplay elements
        so we can turn to polish, however we will still be flexible enough to
        accommodate changes. We look forward to having our peers get their hands
        on this new playable!

      <p>
        While the reaction to our second prototype was positive in many ways, it
        was just that: a prototype. It became clear to us, throughout the week,
        that none of us had a clear idea about what type of game we were really
        making; was it an interactive narrative, a puzzle game, an action game?
        We were trying to fit all these concepts into a single package and it
        became overwhelming quickly. Rather than retrofit our ideas to the
        existing game mechanics that were already worked out, we decided to go
        back to the drawing board.
      </p>

      <p>
        We began to discuss what kind of mechanics we wanted to explore, which
        led us settling on a style of game similar to Portal, The Talos
        Principle or Antichamber. These three games are first-person puzzle
        games that largely involved lateral thinking challenges with some light
        skill-based elements. We also narrowed the thematic focus of our game
        down as well and decided to focus on the theme of “recovery” in a more
        pointed way. Each level centers around some debilitating condition that
        limits your abilities in one way or another. For example, we designed a
        level around traversing underwater tunnels initially with a limited
        pulmonary capacity. Because of the strict time limitation for how long
        you are able to remain in the underwater maze, you need to create
        shortcuts for yourself. Partway through the level, your oxygen levels
        are doubled, resulting in more paths being opened up. Cole planned this
        out on paper, moved to a digital drawing tool and then grayboxed it out
        in Unity.

      <p>
        The level layout changed slightly in order to accommodate the underwater
        timer.

        Kit worked on a sprawling, colorful level where you have to switch
        between two characters in order to complete the puzzles. The main
        character can jump and run, while the character in the wheelchair can
        pass under lower overhangs.

        Miquel build a level where you need to balance your time between hot and
        cold areas, while also balancing an physical balance by placing pill
        bottles into buckets to prevent the see-saw like structure from tipping
        over due to viruses.

        Kimi was able to implement sound effects and music into all the levels
        we created. These audio cues add to the game’s playability and overall
        feel. Even though all of are levels are mostly gray placeholder geometry
        and textures, this first playable has quite an atmosphere at times!

      <p>
        While it was daunting to start nearly from scratch, we believe that our
        game will be better for it. We look forward to the feedback we receive
        from our peers getting to test out our first playable!

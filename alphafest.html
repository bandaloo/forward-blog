      <p>
        Despite all difficulties, we have recently been able to showcase our
        game in Alphafest. This year it had be carried out online, but this
        limitation didnâ€™t stop many IMGD students and professors to meet and try
        out new games in development. This has allowed us to get feedback from a
        broader variety of players, which will help us polish our game during
        the final weeks of this semester.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because each playtest was carried out individually and we only had a few
        hours, we did not recieve enough new playtesting form submissions to
        state anything statistically significant based on the Likert-scale
        responses alone. Therefore, the data we gathered is largely qualitative
        and based on the conversations with the playtesters.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the main changes we made before Alphafest was redesigning the
        "Support Level" from the ground up. In the past, we tweaked the original
        level in order to address some of the playability issues, but even with
        these continuous incremental changes the responses to the gameplay was
        still one of frustration and confusion. Because of this, we decided to
        build an entirely new puzzle for the character switching mechanic,
        partially inspired by the gameplay elements in the previous level,
        namely using colored pressure plates and boxes to activate colored
        elevators. In the previous version of the Support Level, what buttons
        triggered what actions was somewhat arbitrary; the semiotics related to
        gameplay mechanics was inconsistent. Therefore, puzzle solving was
        relegated to pressing buttons until enough things changed to make
        progress in the puzzle. By reusing gameplay mechanics from the previous
        level, and eliminating the finicky physics-based puzzles, we hoped to
        create a more satisfying lateral thinking challenge.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, this level was in a relatively unpolished state, so we
        initially decided to let playtesters test the earlier version of the
        level. When it became clear that playtesters were spending a very long
        time battling with the inconsistent physics puzzle elements, we decided
        to swap out the build half-way through Alphafest in order to get some
        feedback on the new level. This helped us find some bugs (and one
        exploit that involved using a moveable box as an unintended platform, as
        one playtester cleverly found.)
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond the reaction to the mechanics in the old and revamped Support
        Level, we also gathered people's thoughts on the overall presentation.
        Players liked the glitch-art aesthetic, comparing the look and feel to a
        nightmarish dream. The voice acting and cinematic elements were also
        received well. All of this feedback will help us in the final stretch of
        time we have to polish the final product.
